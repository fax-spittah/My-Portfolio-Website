This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my work as a Full Stack Developer. It highlights my projects, technical skills, experience, and CV in a clean, performant, and responsive way.

The site itself is treated as a production-ready project, focusing on good UI/UX, accessibility, and modern web best practices.
